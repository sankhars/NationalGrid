# NationalGrid
National Grid lies at the heart of a transforming energy system.

Our business areas play a vital role in connecting millions of people to the energy they use, while continually seeking ways to make the energy system cleaner. National Grid Ventures and National Grid Partners also enable innovations to help revolutionise and decarbonise the future of energy.

What is National Grid? Weâ€™re the largest electricity transmission and distribution business in the UK, delivering electricity safely, reliably and efficiently to the customers and communities we serve, while working towards a cleaner, greener energy future.

What role does National Grid play in my energy bill? The bill you receive from your energy supplier is made up of a number of separate charges. Some of these charges are based on the different stages through which electricity makes its way from the producers to your home, so we explain this journey and where National Grid fits in.

Our vision for a fossil-free future Our vision is to eliminate fossil fuels from our US gas and electric systems, enabling the people and communities we serve to meet their heating needs without using fossil fuels by 2050 or sooner.

Bringing energy to your region Western Power Distribution is now called National Grid. You don't need to do anything differently - we're the same people dedicated to keeping the electricity on in your local area, and you still call 105 if there's a power cut
